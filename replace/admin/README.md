# Problem 2: Replace It

## tl;dr
This lab was designed to teach you more about Java's `ListIterator` class.

## Getting Started
Read in a list of words and a word to remove from the list. Remove all occurrences of the word from the list. **You must use an `Iterator`.**

Here's how to download this problem's "distribution code" (i.e., starter code) into your own CS50 IDE. Log into CS50 IDE and then, in a terminal window, execute each of the following:

1. Execute `cd` to ensure that you're in `~/` (i.e., your home directory).
1. Execute `cd unit01` to change into (i.e., open) that directory.
1. Execute `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mr-poston/labs-cs3/2020/replace/replace.zip` to download a (compressed) ZIP file with this problem's distribution.
1. Execute `unzip replace.zip` to uncompress that file.
1. Execute `rm replace.zip` followed by `yes` or `y` to delete that ZIP file.
1. Execute `ls`. You should see a directory called `replace`, which was inside that ZIP file.
1. Execute `cd replace` to change to that directory.
1. Execute `ls`. You should see this problem's distribution code, including `Grader.java`, `IteratorReplacer.java`, and `IteratorReplacerRunner.java`.
1. To open a file for editing, use the `open` command or double click the file name in the lefthand file browser.
